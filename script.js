// Assignment Code
  // GIVEN I need a new, secure password
  // need a button or link to get a new password
  // need to show the password on the page

var generateBtn = document.querySelector("#generate");

// Write password to the #password input
function writePassword() {
  // WHEN I click the button to generate a password
  // THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
  var password = generatePassword();
  var passwordText = document.querySelector("#password");

  // WHEN the password is generated
// THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
  passwordText.value = password;

}

// ************************ function here *********************************
// write a function called generatePassword which will have a series of prompts for user input

// WHEN prompted for password criteria
// THEN I select which criteria to include in the password


// WHEN prompted for the length of the password
// THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
// We have to ask the user for how many characters they want in a password
// we have to check to make sure it is between 8 and 128
// otherwise, we tell user to fix their input.

// WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
// THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
// confirm if they want lowercase
// confirm if they want uppercase
// confirm if they want numeric
// confirm if they want special characters

// WHEN I answer each prompt
// THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
// we need to show an error if they gave us no characters to choose from

// WHEN all prompts are answered
// THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
// from all the characters chosen, choose one randomly and add it to our password X number of times
// 

// ************************ function ends here *********************************

// Add event listener to generate button
generateBtn.addEventListener("click", writePassword);
